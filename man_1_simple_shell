.TH HSH 1 "November 2025" "Version 1.0" "Simple Shell Manual"
.SH NAME
hsh \- simple UNIX command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple UNIX command line interpreter that reads commands from either a file or standard input and executes them.
.PP
.B hsh
is a basic implementation of a shell that replicates some of the basic functionality of the standard shell
.B /bin/sh.
It can be used both interactively and non-interactively.
.SH INVOCATION
.B hsh
can be invoked both interactively and non-interactively. If
.B hsh
is invoked with standard input not connected to a terminal, it reads and executes received commands in order.
.PP
If
.B hsh
is invoked with standard input connected to a terminal (determined by
.BR isatty (3)),
an interactive shell is opened. When executing interactively,
.B hsh
displays the prompt
.B $
when it is ready to read a command.
.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
After receiving a command,
.B hsh
tokenizes it into words using
.B " "
(space) as a delimiter. The first word is considered the command and all remaining words are considered arguments to that command.
.B hsh
then proceeds with the following actions:
.IP 1. 3
If the command is a built-in command (see
.B BUILT-IN COMMANDS
below),
.B hsh
executes it directly.
.IP 2.
If the first character of the command is a slash (/) or dot (.),
.B hsh
executes it directly using that path.
.IP 3.
If the command does not contain a slash,
.B hsh
searches for it in the directories listed in the
.B PATH
environment variable.
.IP 4.
If the command is not found,
.B hsh
prints an error message and returns to the prompt.
.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
The following built-in commands are supported:
.TP
.B exit
Exit the shell with the status of the last command executed.
.TP
.B env
Print the current environment variables.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.B hsh
returns the exit status of the last command executed, unless a syntax error occurs, with zero indicating success and non-zero indicating failure.
.PP
The following exit codes have special meanings:
.IP 0
Successful program execution
.IP 1
General errors (e.g., fork failure)
.IP 2
Misuse of shell command
.IP 127
Command not found
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B PATH
The default search path for executables. Each directory in
.B PATH
is separated by a colon
.BR : .
.TP
.B environ
An array of strings containing the environment variables.
